* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 9781292057125
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-1292057125
  * * Author: Douglas Giancoli
   
  * Elegant, engaging, exacting, and concise, Giancoli’s Physics: Principles with Applications helps students view the world through eyes that know physics.
 
  * Giancoli’s text is a trusted classic, known for its elegant writing, clear presentation, and quality of content. Using concrete observations and experiences students can relate to, the text features an approach that reflects how science is actually practiced: it starts with the specifics, then moves to the great generalisations and the more formal aspects of a topic to show students why we believe what we believe.
 
  * Written with the goal of giving students a thorough understanding of the basic concepts of physics in all its aspects, the text uses interesting applications to biology, medicine, architecture, and digital technology to show students how useful physics is in their own everyday lives and in their future professions.
